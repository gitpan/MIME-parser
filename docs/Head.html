MIME::Head - MIME message header


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="alpharelease_warning">ALPHA-RELEASE WARNING</A></H1>
<EM><STRONG>This code is in an evaluation phase until 1 August 1996.</STRONG>

Depending on any comments/complaints received before this cutoff date, 
the interface <STRONG>may</STRONG>
 change in a non-backwards-compatible manner.</EM>





<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
A class for parsing in and manipulating RFC-822 message headers, with some
methods geared towards standard (and not so standard) MIME fields as
specified in RFC-1521, <EM>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</EM>
.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
Start off by requiring or using this package:


<P>

<PRE>
    require MIME::Head;
</PRE>

<P>

You can create a MIME::Head object in a number of ways:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Create a new, empty header, and populate it manually:    
    $head = MIME::Head-&gt;new;
    $head-&gt;set('content-type', 'text/plain; charset=US-ASCII');
    $head-&gt;set('content-length', $len);
    
    # Create a new header by parsing in the STDIN stream:
    $head = MIME::Head-&gt;read(\*STDIN);
    
    # Create a new header by parsing in a file:
    $head = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file(&quot;/tmp/test.hdr&quot;);
    
    # Create a new header by running a program:
    $head = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file(&quot;cat a.hdr b.hdr |&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

To get rid of all internal newlines in all fields:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Get rid of all internal newlines:
    $head-&gt;unfold();
</PRE>

<P>

To test whether a given field exists:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Was a &quot;Subject:&quot; given?
    if ($head-&gt;exists('subject')) {
        # yes, it does!
    }
</PRE>

<P>

To get the contents of that field as a string:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Is this a reply?
    $reply = 1 if ($head-&gt;get('Subject') =~ /^Re: /);
</PRE>

<P>

To set the contents of a field to a given string:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Is this a reply?
    $head-&gt;set('Content-type', 'text/html');
</PRE>

<P>

To extract parameters from certain structured fields, as a hash reference:


<P>

<PRE>
    # What's the MIME type?
    $params = $head-&gt;params('content-type');
    $mime_type = $$params{_};
    $char_set  = $$params{'charset'};
    $file_name = $$params{'name'};
</PRE>

<P>

To get certain commonly-used MIME information:


<P>

<PRE>
    $mime_type = $head-&gt;mime_type;
    
    $mime_encoding = $head-&gt;mime_encoding;
    
    $file_name = $head-&gt;recommended_filename;
    
    $boundary = $head-&gt;multipart_boundary;
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="compatibility_tweaks">COMPATIBILITY TWEAKS</A></H1>
The parser may be tweaked so that any line in the header stream that begins
with <CODE>"From "</CODE> will be either <STRONG>ignored</STRONG>
, flagged as an 
<STRONG>error</STRONG>
, or <STRONG>coerced</STRONG>
 into the special field <CODE>"Mail-from:"</CODE> 
(the default; this approach was inspired by Emacs's ``Babyl'' format).
Though not valid for a MIME header, this will provide compatibility with
some Unix mail messages. Just do this:


<P>

<PRE>
    MIME::Head-&gt;tweak_FROM_parsing($choice)
</PRE>

<P>

Where <CODE>$choice</CODE> is one of <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, <CODE>ERROR</CODE>, or <CODE>COERCE</CODE>.


<P>

<H1><A NAME="public_interface">PUBLIC INTERFACE</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="creation_input_and_output">Creation, input, and output</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_new">new

</A></STRONG><DD>
<EM>Class method</EM>
. Creates a new header object, with no fields.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_from_file_expr">from_file EXPR

</A></STRONG><DD>
<EM>Class or instance method</EM>
. For convenience, you can use this to parse a header object in from EXPR,
which may actually be any expression that can be sent to
<CODE>open()</CODE> so as to return a readable filehandle. The ``file''
will be opened, read, and then closed:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Create a new header by parsing in a file:
    my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;from_file(&quot;/tmp/test.hdr&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

Since this method can function as either a class constructor <EM>or</EM>
 
an instance initializer, the above is exactly equivalent to:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Create a new header by parsing in a file:
    my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;new-&gt;from_file(&quot;/tmp/test.hdr&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

On success, the object will be returned; on failure, the undefined value.


<P>

This is really just a convenience front-end onto <CODE>read()</CODE>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_read_filehandle">read FILEHANDLE

</A></STRONG><DD>
<EM>Class or instance method</EM>
. This constructs a header object by reading it in from a FILEHANDLE, until
either a blank line or an end-of-stream is encountered. A syntax error will
also halt processing.


<P>

Supply this routine with a reference to a filehandle glob; e.g., <CODE>\*STDIN</CODE>:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Create a new header by parsing in STDIN:
    my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;read(\*STDIN);
</PRE>

<P>

Since this method can function as either a class constructor <EM>or</EM>
 
an instance initializer, the above is exactly equivalent to:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Create a new header by parsing in STDIN:
    my $head = MIME::Head-&gt;new-&gt;read(\*STDIN);
</PRE>

<P>

Except that you should probably use th first form. On success, the object
will be returned; on failure, the undefined value.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_print_filehandle">print FILEHANDLE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Output to the given FILEHANDLE, or to the currently-selected filehandle if
none was given:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Output to STDOUT:
    $head-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG>
 this method does not output the blank line that terminates the header in a
legal message (since you may not always want it).


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="gettingsetting_fields">Getting/setting fields</A></H2>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
 this interface is not as extensive as that of MIME::Internet; however, I
have provided a set of methods that I can guarantee are supportable across
any changes to the internal implementation of this class.


<P>

Anything that you can't do here, you'll have to do 


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_add_fieldtextwhere">add FIELD,TEXT,[WHERE]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Add a new occurence of the FIELD, given by TEXT:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Add the trace information:    
    $head-&gt;add('Received', 'from eryq.pr.mcs.net by gonzo.net with smtp');
</PRE>

<P>

The FIELD is automatically coerced to lowercase. Returns the TEXT.


<P>

Normally, the new occurence will be <EM>appended</EM>
 to the existing occurences. However, if the optional WHERE argument is the
string <CODE>"BEFORE"</CODE>, then the new occurence will be <EM>prepended</EM>
.
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
 if you want to be <EM>explicit</EM>
 about appending, use the string <CODE>"AFTER"</CODE> for this argument.


<P>

<STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>
: this method always adds new occurences; it doesn't overwrite any existing
occurences... so if you just want to <EM>change</EM>
 the value of a field (creating it if necessary), then you probably <STRONG>don't</STRONG>
 want to use this method: consider using <CODE>set()</CODE> instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_add_text_fieldtext">add_text FIELD,TEXT

</A></STRONG><DD>
Add some more text to the [last occurence of the] field:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Force an explicit character set:
    if ($head-&gt;get('Content-type') !~ /\bcharset=/) {
        $head-&gt;add_text('Content-type', '; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;');
    }
</PRE>

<P>

The FIELD is automatically coerced to lowercase.


<P>

<STRONG>WARNING: be careful if adding text that contains a newline!</STRONG>

A newline in a field value <EM>must</EM>
 be followed by a single space or tab to be a valid continuation line!  


<P>

I had considered building this routine so that it ``fixed'' bare newlines
for you, but then I decided against it, since the behind-the-scenes
trickery would probably create more problems through confusion. So,
instead, you've just been warned... proceed with caution.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_delete_field">delete FIELD

</A></STRONG><DD>
Delete all occurences of the given field.


<P>

<PRE>
    # Remove all the MIME information:
    $head-&gt;delete('MIME-Version');
    $head-&gt;delete('Content-type');
    $head-&gt;delete('Content-transfer-encoding');
    $head-&gt;delete('Content-disposition');
</PRE>

<P>

Currently returns 1 always.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_exists_field">exists FIELD

</A></STRONG><DD>
Returns whether a given field exists:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Was a &quot;Subject:&quot; given?
    if ($head-&gt;exists('subject')) {
        # yes, it does!
    }
</PRE>

<P>

The FIELD is automatically coerced to lowercase. This method returns the
undefined value if the field doesn't exist, and some true value if it does.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_fields">fields

</A></STRONG><DD>
Return a list of all fields (in no particular order):


<P>

<PRE>
    foreach $field (sort $head-&gt;fields) {
        print &quot;$field: &quot;, $head-&gt;get($field), &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_get_fieldoccur">get FIELD,[OCCUR]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Returns the text of the [first occurence of the] field, or the empty string
if the field is not present (nice for avoiding those ``undefined value''
warnings):


<P>

<PRE>
    # Is this a reply?
    $is_reply = 1 if ($head-&gt;get('Subject') =~ /^Re: /);
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
 this returns the <EM>first</EM>
 occurence of the field, so as to be consistent with Mail::Internet::get().
However, if the optional OCCUR argument is defined, it specifies the index
of the occurence you want: 
<STRONG>zero</STRONG>
 for the first, and <STRONG>-1</STRONG>
 for the last.


<P>

<PRE>
    # Print the first 'Received:' entry:
    print &quot;Most recent: &quot;, $head-&gt;get('received'), &quot;\n&quot;;
    
    # Print the first 'Received:' entry, explicitly:
    print &quot;Most recent: &quot;, $head-&gt;get('received', 0), &quot;\n&quot;;
    
    # Print the last 'Received:' entry:
    print &quot;Least recent: &quot;, $head-&gt;get('received', -1), &quot;\n&quot;; 
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_get_all_field">get_all FIELD

</A></STRONG><DD>
Returns the list of <EM>all</EM>
 occurences of the field, or the empty list if the field is not present:


<P>

<PRE>
    # How did it get here?
    @history = $head-&gt;get_all('Received');
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
 I had originally experimented with having <CODE>get()</CODE> return all occurences when invoked in an array context... but that causes a
lot of accidents when you get careless and do stuff like this:


<P>

<PRE>
    print &quot;\u$field: &quot;, $head-&gt;get($field), &quot;\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

It also made the intuitive behaviour unclear if the OCCUR argument was
given in an array context. So I opted for an explicit approach to asking
for all occurences.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_original_text">original_text

</A></STRONG><DD>
Recover the original text that was <CODE>read()</CODE> in to create this
object:


<P>

<PRE>
    print &quot;PARSED FROM:\n&quot;, $head-&gt;original_text;    
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_set_fieldtext">set FIELD,TEXT

</A></STRONG><DD>
Set the field to [the single occurence given by] the TEXT:


<P>

<PRE>
    # Set the MIME type:
    $head-&gt;set('content-type', 'text/html');
    
The FIELD is automatically coerced to lowercase.
This method returns the text.
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_unfold_field">unfold [FIELD]

</A></STRONG><DD>
Unfold the text of all occurences of the given FIELD. If the FIELD is
omitted, <EM>all</EM>
 fields are unfolded.


<P>

``Unfolding'' is the act of removing all newlines.


<P>

<PRE>
    $head-&gt;unfold;
</PRE>

<P>

Currently, returns 1 always.


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="mimespecific_stuff">MIME-specific stuff</A></H2>
All of the following methods extract information from the following
structured fields:


<P>

<PRE>
    Content-type
    Content-transfer-encoding
    Content-disposition
</PRE>

<P>

Be aware that they do not just return the raw contents of those fields, and
in some cases they will fill in sensible (I hope) default values. Use <CODE>get()</CODE> if you need to grab and process the raw field text.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_params_field">params FIELD

</A></STRONG><DD>
Extract parameter info from a structured field, and return it as a hash
reference. For example, here is a field with parameters:


<P>

<PRE>
    Content-Type: Message/Partial;
        number=2; total=3;
        id=&quot;oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

Here is how you'd extract them:


<P>

<PRE>
    $params = $head-&gt;params('content-type');
    if ($$params{_} eq 'message/partial') {
        $number = $$params{'number'};
        $total  = $$params{'total'};
        $id     = $$params{'id'};
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Like field names, parameter names are coerced to lowercase. The special '_'
parameter means the default parameter for the field.


<P>

<STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG>
 the syntax is a little different for each field (content-type,
content-disposition, etc.). I've attempted to come up with a nice, simple
catch-all solution: it simply stops when it can't match anything else.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_mime_encoding">mime_encoding

</A></STRONG><DD>
Try real hard to determine the content transfer encoding, which is returned
as a non-empty string in all-lowercase.


<P>

If no encoding could be found, the empty string is returned.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_mime_type">mime_type

</A></STRONG><DD>
Try real hard to determine the content type, which is returned as <CODE>"$type/$subtype"</CODE> in all-lowercase.


<P>

<PRE>
    ($type, $subtype) = split('/', $head-&gt;mime_type);
</PRE>

<P>

If <EM>both</EM>
 the type <EM>and</EM>
 the subtype are missing, the content-type defaults to <CODE>"text/plain"</CODE>, as per RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    Default RFC-822 messages are typed by this protocol as plain text in
    the US-ASCII character set, which can be explicitly specified as
    &quot;Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii&quot;.  If no Content-Type is
    specified, this default is assumed.  
</PRE>

<P>

If <EM>just</EM>
 the subtype is missing (really a syntax error, but we'll tolerate it, since
some mailers actually do this), then the subtype defaults to <CODE>"x-subtype-unknown"</CODE>. This may change in the future, since I don't know if this was a really
horrible idea: unfortunately, there is no standard default subtype, and
even when a good default can be decided upon, I felt queasy about returning
the erroneous <CODE>"text"</CODE> as either the legal <CODE>"text/plain"</CODE>
or the still-illegal <CODE>"text/"</CODE>.


<P>

If the content type is present but can't be parsed at all (yow!), the empty
string is returned.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_multipart_boundary">multipart_boundary

</A></STRONG><DD>
If this is a header for a multipart message, return the ``encapsulation
boundary'' used to separate the parts. The boundary is returned exactly as
given in the <CODE>Content-type:</CODE> field; that is, the leading double-hyphen (<CODE>--</CODE>) is <EM>not</EM>
 prepended.


<P>

(Well, <EM>almost</EM>
 exactly... from RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
   (If a boundary appears to end with white space, the white space 
   must be presumed to have been added by a gateway, and must be deleted.)  
</PRE>

<P>

so we oblige and remove any trailing spaces.)


<P>

Returns undef (<STRONG>not</STRONG>
 the empty string) if either the message is not multipart, if there is no
specified boundary, or if the boundary is illegal (e.g., if it is empty
after all trailing whitespace has been removed).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_recommended_filename">recommended_filename

</A></STRONG><DD>
Return the recommended external filename. This is used when extracting the
data from the MIME stream.


<P>

Returns undef if no filename could be suggested.

<H2><A NAME="implementation">Implementation</A></H2>
Looking at a typical mail message header, it is sooooooo tempting to just
store the fields as a hash of strings, one string per hash entry.
Unfortunately, there's the little matter of the <CODE>Received:</CODE> field, which (unlike <CODE>From:</CODE>, <CODE>To:</CODE>, etc.) will often have multiple occurences; e.g.:


<P>

<PRE>
    Received: from gsfc.nasa.gov by eryq.pr.mcs.net  with smtp
        (Linux Smail3.1.28.1 #5) id m0tStZ7-0007X4C; Thu, 21 Dec 95 16:34 CST
    Received: from rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov by gsfc.nasa.gov (5.65/Ultrix3.0-C)
        id AA13596; Thu, 21 Dec 95 17:20:38 -0500
    Received: (from eryq@localhost) by rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov (8.6.12/8.6.12) 
        id RAA28069; Thu, 21 Dec 1995 17:27:54 -0500
    Date: Thu, 21 Dec 1995 17:27:54 -0500
    From: Eryq &lt;eryq@rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov&gt;
    Message-Id: &lt;199512212227.RAA28069@rhine.gsfc.nasa.gov&gt;
    To: eryq@eryq.pr.mcs.net
    Subject: Stuff and things
</PRE>

<P>

The <CODE>Received:</CODE> field is used for tracing message routes, and although it's not generally
used for anything other than human debugging, I didn't want to
inconvenience anyone who actually wanted to get at that information. I <EM>also</EM>
 didn't want to make this a special case; after all, who knows what other
fields could have multiple occurences in the future? So, clearly, multiple
entries had to somehow be stored multiple times.
