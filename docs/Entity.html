MIME::Entity - class for parsed-and-decoded MIME message


<P>

<EM><STRONG>WARNING: This code is in an evaluation phase until 1 August 1996.</STRONG>

Depending on any comments/complaints received before this cutoff date, 
the interface <STRONG>may</STRONG>
 change in a non-backwards-compatible manner.</EM>

<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
This package provides a class for representing MIME message entities, as
specified in RFC 1521, <EM>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</EM>
.


<P>

Here are some excerpts from RFC-1521 explaining the terminology: each is
accompanied by the equivalent in MIME:: terms:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_message">Message

</A></STRONG><DD>
From RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    The term &quot;message&quot;, when not further qualified, means either the
    (complete or &quot;top-level&quot;) message being transferred on a network, or
    a message encapsulated in a body of type &quot;message&quot;.
</PRE>

<P>

There currently is no explicit package for messages; under MIME::, messages
may be read in from readable files or filehandles. A future extension will
allow them to be read from any object reference that responds to a special
``next line'' method.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_body_part">Body part

</A></STRONG><DD>
From RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    The term &quot;body part&quot;, in this document, means one of the parts of the
    body of a multipart entity. A body part has a header and a body, so
    it makes sense to speak about the body of a body part.
</PRE>

<P>

Since a body part is just a kind of entity (see below), a body part is
represented by an instance of MIME::Entity.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_entity">Entity

</A></STRONG><DD>
From RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    The term &quot;entity&quot;, in this document, means either a message or a body
    part.  All kinds of entities share the property that they have a
    header and a body.
</PRE>

<P>

An entity is represented by an instance of MIME::Entity. There are instance
methods for recovering the header (a MIME::Head) and the body (see below).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_body">Body

</A></STRONG><DD>
From RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    The term &quot;body&quot;, when not further qualified, means the body of an
    entity, that is the body of either a message or of a body part.
</PRE>

<P>

Well, this is a toughie. Both Mail::Internet (1.17) and Mail::MIME (1.03)
represent message bodies in-core; unfortunately, this is not always the
best way to handle things, especially for MIME streams that contain
multi-megabyte tar files.

Assuming we are a multipart message, add a body part (a MIME::Entity) to
the array of body parts. Do <STRONG>not</STRONG>
 call this for single-part messages; i.e., don't call it unless the header
has a <CODE>"multipart"</CODE> content-type.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_body_optvalue">body OPTVALUE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Get or set the path to the file containing the body.


<P>

If <CODE>OPTVALUE</CODE>  <EM>is not</EM>
 given, the current body file is returned. If <CODE>OPTVALUE</CODE>  <EM>is</EM>
 given, the body file is set to the new value, and the previous value is
returned.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_head_optvalue">head OPTVALUE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Get or set the head.


<P>

If <CODE>OPTVALUE</CODE>  <EM>is not</EM>
 given, the current head is returned. If <CODE>OPTVALUE</CODE>  <EM>is</EM>
 given, the head is set to the new value, and the previous value is
returned.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_is_multipart">is_multipart

</A></STRONG><DD>
Does this entity's MIME type indicate that it's a multipart entity? Returns
undef (false) if the answer couldn't be determined, 0 (false) if it was
determined to be false, and true otherwise.


<P>

Note that this says nothing about whether or not parts were extracted.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_parts">parts

</A></STRONG><DD>
Return an array of all sub parts (each of which is a MIME::Entity), or the
empty array if there are none.  


<P>

For single-part messages, the empty array will be returned. For multipart
messages, the preamble and epilogue parts are <EM>not</EM>
 in the list! If you want them, use <CODE>all_parts()</CODE> instead.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_dump_skeleton_filehandle">dump_skeleton FILEHANDLE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Dump the skeleton of the entity to the given FILEHANDLE, or to the
currently-selected one if none given.

A <STRONG>MIME::Entity</STRONG>
 is composed of the following elements:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
A <EM>head</EM>
, which is a reference to a MIME::Head object.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
A <EM>body</EM>
, which (currently) is a path to a file containing the decoded body. It is
possible for a multipart entity to have a body; this simply means that the
body file contains a MIME message that hasn't yet been split into its
component parts.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
A list of zero or more <EM>parts</EM>
, each of which is a MIME::Entity object. The number of parts will only be
nonzero if the content-type is some subtype of <CODE>"multipart"</CODE>.

When I rewrote this module for the CPAN, I agonized for a long time about
whether or not it really should just be a subclass of <STRONG>Mail::Internet</STRONG>
 (or the experimental <STRONG>Mail::MIME</STRONG>
). There were plusses:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Software reuse.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Inheritance of the mail-sending utilities.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
Elimination and stamping out of repetitive redundancies.


<P>

</UL>
And, unfortunately, minuses:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The Mail::Internet model of messages as being short enough to fit into
in-core arrays is excellent for most email applications; however, it seemed
ill-suited for generic MIME applications, where MIME streams could be
megabytes long.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The current implementation of Mail::Internet (version 1.17) is excellent
for certain kinds of header manipulation; however, the <CODE>get()</CODE>
method (for retrieveing a field's value) does a brute-force, regexp-based
search through a linear array of the field values - worse, with a
dynamically-compiled search pattern. Even given small headers, I was simply
too uncomfortable with this approach for the MIME header applications,
which could be fairly <CODE>get()-intensive.</CODE>


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
In my heart of hearts, I honestly feel that the head should be encapsulated
as a first-class object, separate from any attached body. Notice that this
approach allows the head to be folded into the entity in the future; that
is:


<P>

<PRE>
    $entity-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject');
</PRE>

<P>

...can work even if <CODE>MIME::Head</CODE> objects are eliminated, and 
<CODE>MIME::Entity</CODE> objects become the ones that handle the <CODE>get()</CODE> 
method. To do this, we'd simply define <CODE>MIME::Entity::head()</CODE> to return the ``self'' object, which would ``pretend'' to be the ``header''
object. Like this:


<P>

<PRE>
    sub head { $_[0] }
</PRE>

<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
While MIME streams follow RFC-822 syntax, they are not, strictly speaking,
limited to email messages: HTTP is an excellent example of non-email-based
MIME. So the inheritance from Mail::Internet was not without question
anyway.


<P>

</UL>
<STRONG>The compromise.</STRONG>
  Currently, MIME::Head is its own module. However:


<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
When a MIME::Head is constructed using <CODE>read()</CODE> (or <CODE>from_file()</CODE>), the original parsed header is stored, in all its flat-text glory, in the
MIME::Head object, and may be recovered via the <CODE>original_text()</CODE>
method.


<P>

<LI><STRONG></STRONG>
The conversion methods <CODE>from_mail()</CODE> and <A HREF="#item_to_mail">to_mail</A> are provided in MIME::Entity class.


<P>

</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="some_things_just_cant_be_ignored">Some things just can't be ignored</A></H2>
In multipart messages, the <EM>"preamble"</EM>
 is the portion that precedes the first encapsulation boundary, and the <EM>"epilogue"</EM>
 is the portion that follows the last encapsulation boundary.


<P>

According to RFC-1521:


<P>

<PRE>
    There appears to be room for additional information prior to the
    first encapsulation boundary and following the final boundary.  These
    areas should generally be left blank, and implementations must ignore
    anything that appears before the first boundary or after the last
    one.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>
    NOTE: These &quot;preamble&quot; and &quot;epilogue&quot; areas are generally not used
    because of the lack of proper typing of these parts and the lack
    of clear semantics for handling these areas at gateways,
    particularly X.400 gateways.  However, rather than leaving the
    preamble area blank, many MIME implementations have found this to
    be a convenient place to insert an explanatory note for recipients
    who read the message with pre-MIME software, since such notes will
    be ignored by MIME-compliant software.
</PRE>

<P>

In the world of standards-and-practices, that's the standard. Now for the
practice: 


<P>

<EM>Some MIME mailers may incorrectly put a "part" in the preamble</EM>
, Since we have to parse over the stuff <EM>anyway</EM>
, in the future I will allow the parser option of creating special
MIME::Entity objects for the preamble and epilogue, with bogus MIME::Head
objects.
